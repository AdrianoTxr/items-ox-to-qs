## Requirements
Before using this resource, ensure that your FiveM server meets the following requirements:

- **[Quasar Inventory](https://buy.quasar-store.com/package/5677336)**: The target inventory system where items will be converted. Ensure it is properly installed and configured on your server. You can find more information and installation instructions on the [Quasar Inventory docs](https://docs.quasar-store.com/assets-and-guides/inventory).
- **[Ox Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)**: The source inventory system from which you are converting items. Make sure it is installed and functioning on your server.

## Introduction
This resource facilitates the conversion of items from Ox Inventory to Quasar Inventory in a FiveM server.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Retrieve Ox Inventory Items

2. Place the obtained file in the `input` folder of this converter.

### Step 2: Add the Converter Resource
1. Copy this resource into your server's `resources` folder.
2. Refresh and start the resource.

### Step 3: Run Conversion Command
